            questions and concerns, ensuring a clear understanding of the
            project's scope. We are thrilled and eager to embark on the next
            phase of the project!

            Bug Collectibles

          <p>
            The game involves placing QR codes at bug exhibits throughout the
            museum. Kids can scan the codes to capture digital versions of bugs
            on their smartphones or provided devices. Each visit allows three
            random bug captures, encouraging repeat visits to collect different
            bugs. The digital bugs ask questions that require exploring the
            museum for answers, promoting learning. Correct answers may earn
            special bug cards, and kids can trade bugs with other visitors to
            complete their collection.

            game.

            Idea 1 and Idea 2 into a cohesive concept. Excitement grew as the

          <p className="underline italic">
          Reflection: Another important milestone of our journey. The solution of 
          combining idea 1 (Bug collectible) and Idea 2 (QR code quiz trivia) is 
          combination to achieve the best of both worlds. The team was very happy
           that we can create an interactive solution by using the Bug Collectible 
           idea while still maintaining a educational approach using the QR code quiz
          trivia idea.
