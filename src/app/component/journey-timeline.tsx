        <p>
          Team 3A and 3B had a fantastic meeting with our esteemed client, Ruth,
          at the Hunterian Museum. It was a delightful experience to explore the
          museum together and gain invaluable insights about the artifacts and
          the project. We took the opportunity to clarify any questions and
          concerns, ensuring a clear understanding of the project's scope. We
          are thrilled and eager to embark on the next phase of the project!

          Bug Collectibles
        </h4>
        <p>
          The game involves placing QR codes at bug exhibits throughout the
          museum. Kids can scan the codes to capture digital versions of bugs on
          their smartphones or provided devices. Each visit allows three random
          bug captures, encouraging repeat visits to collect different bugs. The
          digital bugs ask questions that require exploring the museum for
          answers, promoting learning. Correct answers may earn special bug
          cards, and kids can trade bugs with other visitors to complete their
          collection.

          Qr Code Quiz Trivia
        </h4>
        <p>
          The QR Code quiz/game is a museum scavenger hunt where visitors scan a
          QR code at the entrance, leading them on an adventure to find a
          mystery object. By solving quizzes and games related to exhibits, they
          receive hints to locate QR codes hidden throughout the museum. When
          the initial QR code matches the object's QR code, they win the game.
