                        Hi Ruth, <br></br>  <br></br>

                                  Firstly, We would like to thank you for the enjoyable morning at the Hunterian Museum, thank you so much for the hospitality.

                                  A quick summary of what was discussed: <br></br>
                                  <br></br> 
                                  - A solution need to be made to improve the interactions for children of age 8-11 and 11-14 at the Hunterian Museum.
                                  <br></br>
                                  - The current application use by the museum consist of largely audio interactions, however, we feel that there can be more ways to engage our young visitors. 
                                  <br></br>
                                  - Solution should not make users focus too heavily on their devices and miss the wonders of the museum.
                                  <br></br>
                                  - Some possible challenges include the Wifi strength and the reluctance of visitors to install an app on their devices
                                  <br></br>
                                  - A simple application so that our young visitors can operate and work with
                                  <br></br> <br></br>
                                  In efforts to create such a solution, the team has started our brain storming and requirement gathering process  to formulate a viable solution for this project
                                  Once again, thank you so much for answering our questions and we will be in touch soon.

                        Hi Ruth,<br></br><br></br>

                          We hope this email finds you well. We would like to provide you with an update (20/07) with regards to the project.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          We are happy to announce that the team has started the brainstorming and ideation process by gathering and thinking of feasible ideas. This is extremely important because it allows us to explore our idea before it can be realised. Feasibility and design concerns are extensively discussed while user experience and interfaces are carefully crafted.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          The following idea are some that we are considering:
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          A digital card collection for bugs where visitors can scan a QR code to spin for a random digital collectible bug card that they can keep in their very own collection.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          A QR code quiz game, where users will move around the museum to scan QR code to be redirected into a webpage. At the webpage there are a series of quizzes about artefacts where visitors have to guess which artefacts the quiz is referring to. Upon finding the correct artefact, players will scan the artefact’s QR code to answer the quiz and gain points.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          Multiplayer Co-op where one performs an activity at one area of the museum and another player performs another activity at another part of the museum. They’ll need to collaborate to find out the full information to win the game. The activities might include “artifact theme card-matching” or "count the number of gems stone at the gemstone section”.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          We're excited to see the progress and creativity in the team's ideas! Looking forward to bringing these engaging concepts to life and enhancing the museum experience for all visitors. Let's continue working together to make this project a resounding success!
                          <br></br><br></br>

                        Hi Ruth,<br></br><br></br>

                          This is the update for Team 3A (21/7):
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          Upon brainstorming our ideas, the team went forward with prototyping the ideas with wireframes. Wireframes were brought to the Hunterian Museum to test their feasibility and flow.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          A reflection by the team: Prototyping proved very useful for the team to visualize our ideas, it is only when we see the product's form, did we realize that certain features are infeasible. On top of visualization, prototyping also allowed us to streamline our mental model with regard to how the final product will look or how the product will work. 
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          In conclusion, the team has found prototyping to be a crucial step in product development.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          Pictures of our wireframes and Hunterian Museum visits can be found in the attachment.

                            Just a quick update for today :)
                            <br></br><br></br>
                            Thanks for the discussion today, the insights provided are really helpful. The team has taken up the suggestion and combined two of our ideas together (card collectible + Quiz trivia). I am also pleased to announce that we have started with the high-fidelity prototypes, and we aim complete it by Thursday so that we can share them during the meeting.

                          Today the team continued their efforts in refining our high-fidelity prototype. This intensive process of iterative refinement is so that our solution can be seamless in design and smooth during use. Other than the product’s design, works on the static website has began as well and with the design of the static website still being discussed, the team hopes to finalise a design that can best catch out reader’s attention and best showcase our work.

                          ⁃ There should be a third potential answer to prevent players to just go through without finding it<br></br>
                          ⁃ There could also be something visual, so that they can find something that they could see rather than just read<br></br>
                          ⁃ Multiple choice is better than having a free text as they will have to factor in spelling errors, which may frustrate users.<br></br>

                          Once again, thank you for the feedback and suggestions shared during the meeting. We will continue progressing and hopes to complete the product by the next meeting on Tuesday.

                        Hi Ruth,<br></br><br></br>

                          Good news! Final touches are being done to the product as we speak to ensure that it is usable and error free. The team has achieved great progress over the past few days in realizing the idea and we are excited to present our product to you tomorrow.
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          Additionally, we have some questions to enquire that is crucial for the completion of our school project:
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          1. Can we use The Hunterian Museum logo on our website and poster (which will be presented and submitted to the school) without posing any issues?
                          <br></br><br></br>
                          2. Can we upload the Zoom link and password of our meeting recording on our website (which will be presented and submitted to the school) as a way to document the team's journey over the cause of the project
                          <br></br><br></br>
                        Regards,<br></br>
